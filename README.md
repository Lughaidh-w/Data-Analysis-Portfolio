## Machine Learning Projects
These projects cover a variety of topics in data science. They are organised somewhat by their machine learning goals, but most are end-to-end projects with extensive data wrangling, feature engineering and visualisation. 


### Machine Learning | Supervised Learning


${\textsf{\color{red}Laptop Price Prediction in Python}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Laptop-Price-Prediction<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Supervised learning to predict laptop price from a dataset of laptop features and prices.<br>
<b>Description:</b> What features contribute to laptop pricing?<br>
<b>Results:</b> _<br>

${\textsf{\color{red}Laptop Price Prediction in R}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Laptop-Price-Prediction-in-R<br>
<b>Objective:</b> To predict laptop prices and determine what features impact this.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Translating my laptop price prediction into R. Data exploration demonstration is shown on the dataset, data is then processed as per the findings from the previous experiment in python, and then modelling is performed.<br>
<b>Results:</b>    <br>

${\textsf{\color{red}Airline Customer Satisfaction}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Airline-Customer-Satisfaction<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Predict airline customer satisfaction with classification modelling.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Performing data preparation and binary classificaiton modelling on Airline Customer Satisfaction in python. Related report is inlcuded in report section below.<br>
<b>Results:</b> Support Vector Machine model best fit on data with 94% accuracy.<br>


### Machine Learning | Unsupervised Learning

${\textsf{\color{red}Dimensionality Reduction on Unknown Data}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Dimensionality-Reduction-on-Unknown-Data<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Perform dimensionality reduction on data without context while keeping 99.5% of the variance.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Project from completing the HDip with CCT. Dataset is Air Pressure System failures in Scania Trucks, it features a target feature of failure types. It has anonymised features, lacks context, and has missing data. These discrepencies are investigated with data exploration and the nature of the missing data is understood in relation to failures. Imputation methods are trialed and the data is modelled.<br>
<b>Results:</b> Relationships in the missing data is highlighted. Imputation methods and principal component analysis are performed. Some classifications are then performed on the data.<br>

${\textsf{\color{red}Market Basket Analysis on Grocery Purchases}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b>https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Affinity-Analysis-on-Grocery-Purchases<br>
<b>Objective:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> <br>
<b>Results:</b> _<br>

${\textsf{\color{red}Sentiment Analysis on News Headlines}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Sentiment-Analysis-on-News-Headlines<br>
<b>Objective:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> <br>
<b>Results:</b> _<br>


### Machine Learning | Time-Series Analysis

${\textsf{\color{red}Time-Series Analysis on Stock Data}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Time-Series-Analysis-on-Stock-Data<br>
<b>Objective:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> <br>
<b>Results:</b> _<br>

<!-- Time-Series Analysis on Wind Speed -->

<!-- Chat Log Analysis -->


## Report Writing

I have strong report writing and research skills, and I have included a selection of reports here.

These projects are here to showcase other relevant skils I have.

### SQL

${\textsf{\color{red}SQL Movie Database Creation}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/SQL-Movie-Database-Creation<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Create a database of popular movies using IMDb datasets and MySQL.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Creating tables and database inside MySQL, performing queries for demonstration.<br>
<b>Results:</b> _<br>

### Docker
