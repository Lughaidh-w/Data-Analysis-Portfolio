## Technologies Used
This is a selection of the technologies used in my portfolio.<br>

Most projects will feature python and the usual data science python libraries, 
but I enjoy learning new things and approaching problems in new ways so you might find some exploration in other languages.
This list isn't exhaustive, but I hope it's a good overview of my skills.

Languages used: Python, R, SQL, Scala, JavaScript, Bash
Environments: Anaconda, RStudio, Jupyter, RMarkdown, VSCode, Docker, Node.js

Statistical tests:
Hypothesis testing, A/B testing, probabilities

Databases:
    SQL: MySQL, PostgresSQL
    NoSQL: MongoDB

## Projects
Some projects are WIP.


## Machine Learning Projects
These projects cover a variety of topics in data science. They are organised somewhat by their machine learning goals, but most are end-to-end projects with extensive data wrangling, feature engineering and visualisation.

### Machine Learning | Unsupervised Learning

${\textsf{\color{red}Dimensionality Reduction on Unknown Data}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Dimensionality-Reduction-on-Unknown-Data<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Perform dimensionality reduction on data without context while keeping 99.5% of the variance.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Project from completing the HDip with CCT. Dataset is Air Pressure System failures in Scania Trucks, it features a target feature of failure types. It has anonymised features, lacks context, and has missing data. These discrepencies are investigated with data exploration and the nature of the missing data is understood in relation to failures. Imputation methods are trialed and the data is modelled.<br>
<b>Results:</b> Relationships in the missing data is highlighted. Imputation methods and principal component analysis are performed. Some classifications are then performed on the data.<br>
