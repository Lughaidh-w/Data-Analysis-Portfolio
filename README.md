# Louis Wilkie - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio.
I currently hold a Diploma in Data Analytics for Business, and studying the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics for Business from College of Computing Technology, Dublin.
This portfolio features projects in data science and showcases my analytical, engineering and general working with data skills.
I use a wide range of techniques/languages/processes.

The table of contents below is the best way to navigate my portfolio.
Some projects were completed as part of my education and answer certain questions according to the assignments, the explanations and rational in the accompying assignment outline and submitted reports are ommit>

## Projects
Some projects are WIP.


## Machine Learning Projects
These projects cover a variety of topics in data science. They are organised somewhat by their machine learning goals, but most are end-to-end projects with extensive data wrangling, feature engineering and visualisation. 


### Machine Learning | Supervised Learning

${\textsf{\color{red}Laptop Price Prediction in Python}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Laptop-Price-Prediction<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Supervised learning to predict laptop price from a dataset of laptop features and prices.<br>

<b>Objective:</b> To predict laptop prices and determine what features impact this.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Translating my laptop price prediction into R. Data exploration demonstration is shown on the dataset, data is then processed as per the findings from the previous experiment in python, and then modelling is performed.<br>
<b>Results:</b>    <br>

${\textsf{\color{red}Airline Customer Satisfaction}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Airline-Customer-Satisfaction<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Predict airline customer satisfaction with classification modelling.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Performing data preparation and binary classificaiton modelling on Airline Customer Satisfaction in python. Related report is inlcuded in report section below.<br>
<b>Results:</b> Support Vector Machine model best fit on data with 94% accuracy.<br>

${\textsf{\color{red}Car Emissions Prediction in Scala}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Regression-in-Scala<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Model car emission with Regression in Scala<br>
<b>Description:</b> Data exploration, clearning and modelling using Scala in jupyter notebook with machine learning and Spark libraries.<br>
<b>Results:</b> <br>

${\textsf{\color{red}Steam platform recommendations}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b>Link coming soon <br>
<b>Objective:</b> <br>
<b>Description: </b>Recommendation system using collab and content based filtering, including Steamlit dashboard<br>
<b>Results:</b>This project is completed and will be uploaded soon.<br>


### Machine Learning | Unsupervised Learning

${\textsf{\color{red}Dimensionality Reduction on Unknown Data}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b> https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Dimensionality-Reduction-on-Unknown-Data<br>
<b>Objective:</b> Perform dimensionality reduction on data without context while keeping 99.5% of the variance.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Project from completing the HDip with CCT. Dataset is Air Pressure System failures in Scania Trucks, it features a target feature of failure types. It has anonymised features, lacks context, and has missing data. These discrepencies are investigated with data exploration and the nature of the missing data is understood in relation to failures. Imputation methods are trialed and the data is modelled.<br>
<b>Results:</b> Relationships in the missing data is highlighted. Imputation methods and principal component analysis are performed. Some classifications are then performed on the data.<br>

${\textsf{\color{red}Market Basket Analysis on Grocery Purchases}}$<br>
<b>Link:</b>https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Affinity-Analysis-on-Grocery-Purchases<br>
<b>Objective:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> <br>
<b>Results:</b> _<br>
